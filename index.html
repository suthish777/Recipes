    <ul class="list">
        <li>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>Add sugar to a mixing bowl and grate in lemon zest. 
            Stir and let sit for 1 hour if possible to intensify the lemon flavor. 
            This step can be skipped if necessary.
        </p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Line a loaf pan with greased parchment paper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl; add to lemon sugar. Add butter, eggs, and milk and beat with an electric mixer until batter is smooth and fluffy. 
            Transfer batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out the top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <p>Meanwhile for lemon drizzle topping whisk sugar and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Step 6</h5>
        <p>Poke holes all over the cake with a skewer, and ladle or pour lemon drizzle topping over the top. Let the cake cool all the way to room temperature before removing it from the pan.</p>

    <div class="note">
    <h3 class="note__h">Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>For best results, chill cake in the fridge before serving.</p>
    <p>You can make your own self-rising flour by sifting together 2 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour with 1.5 tablespoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon fine salt.</p>
    <p>The lemon drizzle topping amounts can be doubled for an extra “moist” version of the cake.</p>
